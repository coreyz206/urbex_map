# Urbex Map
### An interactive map of locations for Urban Exploration, using the Google Maps API

------

### To-do list

#### Priority 1  
  * ~Write barebones API to use GET to transfer JSON data from server to client~
  * ~Configure server to use API~
  * Get basicAuth working with the server/API
  * ~Write html + js to get data from server~
  * ~Configure client to parse json and display with Google Maps API~
  * ~Get all that on server and make it publically available~
  
#### Priority 2
  * Move beyond basicAuth to OAuth2 for better security
  * Get a domain name
  * ~Make a panel in html/js for user inputted locations~
  * ~Configure API with a POST to transfer user locations to server~
  * Tiered permissions based on user access level
      *This requires better security implementation, possibly OAuth2 with https

#### Priority 3
  * Configure a PUT in the API for authorized users to edit existing location objects
  * Configure a DELETE in the API for authorized users to delete existing location objects
  * Spice up this readme
  * Publicize discord, maybe make map accessible to non-members (need to discuss)
